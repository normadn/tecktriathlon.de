[![Coverage
Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/qhacks/qhacks-website/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://coveralls.io/github/qhacks/qhacks-website?branch=dev)

This repository contains the QHacks website! The website is to serve as a
marketing resource for our event and to act as a gateway for hackers to access
our [dashboard](https://github.com/qhacks/qhacks-dashboard). In addition to
containing our event website for the current year, this repo also contains
branches that have our websites from our previous years.

The website is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) which utilizes
[React](https://reactjs.org/) to generate static sites. For data fetching we are
using a combination of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) and
[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) from many
different sources. For testing we use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and track our
test coverage using [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/). For more information
about the technical specifications please refer to the
[wiki](https://github.com/qhacks/qhacks-website/wiki).

**Build the website while watching changes:**

`npm run develop`

**Run the linter to check code style:**

`npm run style`

**Run the formatter to fix code style issues:**

`npm run format`

**Run the entire test suite:**

**Run only the Jest tests and report coverage data to Coveralls:**

`npm run jest-tests-with-coverage`

> NOTE: You likely won't need to do this and it will fail because some
> environment variables are required. We use this in our CI environment.

**Run only the Cypress tests with server:**

`npm run cypress-tests`

>NOTE: This will start a server and host the website at the `baseURL` that
>Cypress requires and shut down the server once all the testing is complete.

**Open the Cypress test runner:**

`npm run cypress-open`

**Run only the Cypress tests without server:**

`npm run cypress-run`

>NOTE: To run this you must have the website being served to the `baseURL` set
>in the Cypress config.

**Run only the Cypress tests and record data to the Cypress dashboard:**

`npm run cypress-run-record`

> NOTE: You likely won't need to do this and it will fail because some
